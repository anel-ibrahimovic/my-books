MyBooks is a personal library manager that allows users to add, search, view, and update the status of their books. It supports two interfaces:


🖥️ GUI Version (main.py)

Desktop application built with Python's tkinter library, with features like list display, pop-up input dialogs, and error messages.


💻 CLI Version (console-version.py)

A terminal-based version, offering a text-based interaction for managing your book collection directly from the terminal.


Both versions support:

Adding books with title, author, genre, publish year, and status (Read/Unread).

Searching for books by title.

Updating reading status.

Viewing the current book list.
